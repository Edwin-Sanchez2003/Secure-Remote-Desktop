# Secure-Remote-Desktop
This project demonstrates some cybersecurity principles as well as implements an image transfer over a network.

## Setup
Below are steps to setup the program environment on your system.

0. **Install a package manager.** In order for this project to work on your system, it is recommended that you install a package manager to make sure that package versions/conflicts don't become an issue. I used Anaconda, but any package manager that supports pip should work.

1. **Install requirements.txt** With your environment activated, run the following command to install all of the necessary packages into the environment:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Done!** That is all you need to do to set up the environment. You can now run the following commands to run the program:

    `cd ./src/`, then:

    `python target.py`, then in another terminal:

    `python interface.py`
